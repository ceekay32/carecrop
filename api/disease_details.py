"Crop": "Apple",
"Disease": "Cedar Apple Rust",
"Cause": "Cedar apple rust (Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae) is a fungal disease that depends on two species to spread and develop. It spends a portion of its two-year life cycle on Eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana). The pathogen’s spores develop in late fall on the juniper as a reddish brown gall on young branches of the trees.",
"Prevention": "1. Since the juniper galls are the source of the spores that infect the apple trees, cutting them is a sound strategy if there aren’t too many of them.<br/>2. While the spores can travel for miles, most of the ones that could infect your tree are within a few hundred feet.<br/>3. The best way to do this is to prune the branches about 4-6 inches below the galls."

    'Crop': 'Corn',
    'Disease': 'Grey Leaf Spot',
    'Cause': 'Gray leaf spot lesions on corn leaves hinder photosynthetic activity, reducing carbohydrates allocated towards grain fill. The extent to which gray leaf spot damages crop yields can be estimated based on the extent to which leaves are infected relative to grainfill. Damage can be more severe when developing lesions progress past the ear leaf around pollination time. Because a decrease in functioning leaf area limits photosynthates dedicated towards grainfill, the plant might mobilize more carbohydrates from the stalk to fill kernels.',
    'Prevention': '1. In order to best prevent and manage corn grey leaf spot, the overall approach is to reduce the rate of disease growth and expansion.\n2. This is done by limiting the amount of secondary disease cycles and protecting leaf area from damage until after corn grain formation.\n3. High risk factors for grey leaf spot in corn: \n   a. Susceptible hybrid\n   b. Continuous corn\n   c. Late planting date\n   d. Minimum tillage systems\n   e. Field history of severe disease\n   f. Early disease activity (before tasseling)\n   g.

Occasionally field corn, particularly in the southern half of the state, does become severely affected when weather conditions favor the development and spread of rust fungus',
    'Prevention': '1. Although rust is frequently found on corn in Ohio, very rarely has there been a need for fungicide applications. This is due to the fact that there are highly resistant field corn hybrids available and most possess some degree of resistance.2. However, popcorn and sweet corn can be quite susceptible. In seasons where considerable rust is present on the lower leaves prior to silking and the weather is unseasonably cool and wet, an early fungicide application may be necessary for effective disease control. Numerous fungicides are available for rust control'},

        "Cause of disease": "The black rot fungus overwinters in canes, tendrils, and leaves on the grape vine and on the ground. Mummified berries on the ground or those that are still clinging to the vines become the major infection source the following spring. During rain, microscopic spores (ascospores) are shot out of numerous, black fruiting bodies (perithecia) and are carried by air currents to young, expanding leaves. In the presence of moisture, these spores germinate in 36 to 48 hours and eventually penetrate the leaves and fruit stems. The infection becomes visible after 8 to 25 days. When the weather is wet, spores can be released the entire spring and summer providing continuous infection.",
        "Prevention and cure": [
            "Space vines properly and choose a planting site where the vines will be exposed to full sun and good air circulation. Keep the vines off the ground and insure they are properly tied, limiting the amount of time the vines remain wet thus reducing infection.",
            "Keep the fruit planting and surrounding areas free of weeds and tall grass. This practice will promote lower relative humidity and rapid drying of vines and thereby limit fungal infection.",
            "Use protective fungicide sprays. Pesticides registered to protect the developing new growth include copper, captan, ferbam, mancozeb, maneb, triadimefon, and ziram. Important spraying times are as new shoots are 2 to 4 inches long, and again when they are 10 to 15 inches long, just before bloom, just after bloom, and when the fruit has set."

"Cause": "Black Measles is caused by a complex of fungi that includes several species of Phaeoacremonium, primarily by P. aleophilum (currently known by the name of its sexual stage, Togninia minima), and by Phaeomoniella chlamydospora. The overwintering structures that produce spores (perithecia or pycnidia, depending on the pathogen) are embedded in diseased woody parts of vines. During fall to spring rainfall, spores are released and wounds made by dormant pruning provide infection sites. Wounds may remain susceptible to infection for several weeks after pruning with susceptibility declining over time.",
"Prevention": "1. Delayed pruning, double pruning, and applications of pruning-wound protectants are effective preventative practices in young vineyards. Post-infection practices (sanitation and vine surgery) for use in diseased, mature vineyards are not as effective and are far more costly.\n\n2. Sanitation and vine surgery may help maintain yields. In spring, look for dead spurs or for stunted shoots. Later in summer, when there is a reduced chance of rainfall, cut off cankered portions of the vine beyond the canker, to where wood appears healthy. Then remove diseased, woody debris from the vineyard and destroy it.\n\n3. Consider using fungicides labeled as pruning-wound protectants or alternative materials, such as a wound sealant with 5 percent boric acid in acrylic paint (Tech-Gro B-Lock), which is effective against Eutypa dieback and Esca, or an essential oil (Safecoat VitiSeal)."

The disease primarily affects leaves and stems, but under favorable weather conditions, and if left uncontrolled, can result in considerable defoliation and enhance the chance for tuber infection. Premature defoliation may lead to considerable reduction in yield. 3. Primary infection is difficult to predict since EB is less dependent upon specific weather conditions than late blight.',
        'Prevention': '1. Plant only diseasefree, certified seed. 2. Follow a complete and regular foliar fungicide spray program.  3. Practice good killing techniques to lessen tuber infections. 4. Allow tubers to mature before digging, dig when vines are dry, not wet, and avoid excessive wounding of potatoes during harvesting and handling.'

There are many different strains of P. infestans. These are called clonal lineages and designated by a number code (i.e. US-23). Many clonal lineages affect both tomato and potato, but some lineages are specific to one host or the other. 3. The host range is typically limited to potato and tomato, but hairy nightshade (Solanum physalifolium) is a closely related weed that can readily become infected and may contribute to disease spread. Under ideal conditions, such as a greenhouse, petunia also may become infected.',
        'Prevention': '1. Seed infection is unlikely on commercially prepared tomato seed or on saved seed that has been thoroughly dried.  2. Inspect tomato transplants for late blight symptoms prior to purchase and/or planting, as tomato transplants shipped from southern regions may be infected  3. If infection is found in only a few plants within a field, infected plants should be removed, disced-under, killed with herbicide or flame-killed to avoid spreading through the entire field.'

"Cause": "Powdery mildew infections favor humid conditions with temperatures around 68-81° F. In warm, dry conditions, new spores form and easily spread the disease. Symptoms of powdery mildew first appear mid to late summer and the older leaves are more susceptible. Wind blows spores produced in leaf spots to infect other leaves. Under favorable conditions, powdery mildew can spread very rapidly, often covering all of the leaves.",
"Prevention": "1. Apply fertilizer based on soil test results. Avoid over-applying nitrogen.\n\n2. Provide good air movement around plants through proper spacing, staking of plants and weed control.\n\n3. Once a week, examine five mature leaves for powdery mildew infection. In large plantings, repeat at 10 different locations in the field.\n\n4. If susceptible varieties are growing in an area where powdery mildew has resulted in yield loss in the past, fungicide may be necessary."

Strawberries with leaf scorch may first show signs of issue with the development of small purplish blemishes that occur on the topside of leaves.",
"Prevention": "1. Since this fungal pathogen over winters on the fallen leaves of infect plants, proper garden sanitation is key.\n\n2. This includes the removal of infected garden debris from the strawberry patch, as well as the frequent establishment of new strawberry transplants.\n\n3. The avoidance of waterlogged soil and frequent garden cleanup will help to reduce the likelihood of spread of this fungus."
},

'Tomato___Bacterial_spot': {
"Crop": "Tomato",
"Disease": "Bacterial Spot",
"Cause": "The disease is caused by four species of Xanthomonas (X. euvesicatoria, X. gardneri, X. perforans, and X. vesicatoria). In North Carolina, X. perforans is the predominant species associated with bacterial spot on tomato and X. euvesicatoria is the predominant species associated with the disease on pepper. All four bacteria are strictly aerobic, gram-negative rods with a long whip-like flagellum (tail) that allows them to move in water, which allows them to invade wet plant tissue and cause infection.",
"Prevention": "1. The most effective management strategy is the use of pathogen-free certified seeds and disease-free transplants to prevent the introduction of the pathogen into greenhouses and field production areas. Inspect plants very carefully and reject infected transplants- including your own!\n\n2. In transplant production greenhouses, minimize overwatering and handling of seedlings when they are wet.\n\n3. Trays, benches, tools, and greenhouse structures should be washed and sanitized between seedlings crops.\n\n4. Do not spray, tie, harvest, or handle wet plants as that can spread the disease"

Leaf spots grow together and turn brown. Leaves wither and die but often remain attached to the plant. Fruit infections start as a smooth black irregular area on the stem end of the fruit. As the disease progresses, the infected area becomes sunken, dry and leathery.",
"Prevention": "1. Use drip irrigation and avoid watering foliage.\n\n2. Space plants to provide good air movement between rows and individual plants.\n\n3. Stake, string or prune to increase airflow in and around the plant.\n\n4. Sterilize stakes, ties, trellises etc. with 10 percent household bleach or commercial sanitizer.\n\n5. Circulate air in greenhouses or tunnels with vents and fans and by rolling up high tunnel sides to reduce humidity around plants.\n\n6.

"Crop": "Tomato",
"Disease": "Mosaic Virus",
"Cause": "Tomato mosaic virus and tobacco mosaic virus can exist for two years in dry soil or leaf debris, but will only persist one month if soil is moist. The viruses can also survive in infected root debris in the soil for up to two years. Seed can be infected and pass the virus to the plant but the disease is usually introduced and spread primarily through human activity. The virus can easily spread between plants on workers' hands, tools, and clothes with normal activities such as plant tying, removing of suckers, and harvest. The virus can even survive the tobacco curing process, and can spread from cigarettes and other tobacco products to plant material handled by workers after a cigarette.",
"Prevention": "1. Purchase transplants only from reputable sources and ask about the sanitation procedures they use to prevent disease.\n\n2. Inspect transplants prior to purchase and choose only those showing no clear symptoms.3. Avoid planting in fields where tomato root debris is present, as the virus can survive long-term in roots.\n\n4.
